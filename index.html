					<h4> <a href='https://github.com/MaximeDaigle'> Pictures </a> <span class="small"> Android </span> </h4>

					<h4> <a href='https://github.com/MaximeDaigle/Quoridor'>Quoridor</a> <span class="small">Swing (Java) </span> </h4>
					<p> Quoridor is played on a 9x9 game board. Each player begins at the center space of one edge of the board. The objective is to be the first player to move their pawn to any space on the opposite side of the gameboard from which it begins. The distinguishing characteristic of Quoridor is its twenty walls. The walls are divided equally among the players at the start of the game, and once placed, cannot be moved or removed. In this project, I did the user interface using Model-View-Controller architecture.</p>

					<h4> <a href='https://github.com/MaximeDaigle/Labyrinthe'>Invisible Labyrinth</a>  <span class="small">Java</span> </h4>
					<p> It creates a random labyrinth in a shell. You have only a few seconds to memorize it before the wall become invisible. You have to go to the end with a limited number of life.</p>

					<h4> <a href='https://github.com/MaximeDaigle/EightQueens_Puzzle'>Eigth Queens Puzzle</a><span class="small"> Java </span> </h4>
					<p> The eight queens puzzle is the problem of placing eight chess queens on an 8×8 chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. Thus, a solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. This program finds 11 solutions.</p>
					
					<h4> <a href="https://github.com/MaximeDaigle/AddictionSolitaire">Addiction Solitaire</a></a><span class="small"> JavaScript </span> </h4>
					<p> The goal is to create a row for each suit, where each row starts with the deuce on the left and the king on the right. Three reshuffles are allowed for times when you get stuck. Reshuffling affects all cards not in their proper position.  </p>
