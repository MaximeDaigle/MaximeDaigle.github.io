					<h3 id="about"> About</h3>
					<p> I'm a Mathematics and Computer Science student at the <a href='http://www.umontreal.ca/english/'>Université de Montreal</a>. I'm interested in statistics, data science and machine learning.</p>
					
					<h3 id="experience"> Experience </h3>
					<h4> Canada research chair in Healthcare Analytics and Logistics </h4>
					<h5> Research intern </h5>
					<h6> IVADO Undergraduate Research Scholarships (Canada First Research Excellence Fund) </h6>
					<p> I worked on a Multi-Objective Combinatorial Optimization problem in the <a href='http://hanalog.polymtl.ca/en/'> Hanalog </a> laboratory. Specifically, I worked on finding the best way to compromise between the multiple objectives. The research is done in partnership with <a href='https://www.alayacare.com/'> AlayaCare</a>. The algorithm that I worked on enables <a href='http://www.marketwired.com/press-release/-2240167.htm'> more home care visits</a>. </p>
					
					<h4> Government of Canada </h4>
					<h5> Cloud Computing and Devops Programmer </h5>
					<p> I joined the Chief Information and Security Branch of the <a href='https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/home'> Natural Resources Canada </a> federal department. I reverse-engineered servers and created a modified version of them in the cloud. </p>

					<h4> <a href='https://github.com/MaximeDaigle/metric_modification_comparison'> effect of changing the metric used in KNN, PCoA and Isomap </a> <span class="small"> Scikit-learn </span> </h4>
					<p> KNN, PCoA and Isomap are algorithms that use the euclidean distance. In this notebook, I replace the euclidean distance with two other metrics and look at the effect on the performance of the algorithms. Also, to compare the performance of different dimensionality reductions, I suggest a score based on the Kendall tau distance.</p>
										
					<h4> <a href='https://github.com/MaximeDaigle/UltimateTic-Tac-Toe'> Monte Carlo tree search </a> <span class="small"> Python </span> </h4>
					<p> This program uses <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_tree_search'> Monte Carlo tree search </a>  (which is notably used in <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaGo'> AlphaGo's algorithm</a>) to find the next move to do in a game that has more than 10^50 possible move combinations (ultimate tic-tac-toe).</p>
					
					<h4> <a href='https://github.com/MaximeDaigle/Word-sense-Disambiguation'> Word-sense Disambiguation (NLP) </a> <span class="small"> Weka </span> </h4>
					<p> Word-sense disambiguation (<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word-sense_disambiguation'>WSD</a>) is an open problem of natural language processing. WSD is identifying which sense of a word (i.e. meaning) is used in a sentence, when the word has multiple meanings. In this project, a Naïve Bayes classifier, a Decision Tree, a SVM and a neural network are trained to identify which of the 6 meaning of the word 'interest' is used in a sentence.</p>

					<h4> <a href='https://github.com/MaximeDaigle/Inference-in-Bayesian-Network'> Inference in Bayesian Network </a> <span class="small"> Python </span> </h4>
					<p> Use two methods to compute approximate inference in bayesian networks, rejection sampling and likelihood weighting.</p>
	
					<h4> <a href='https://github.com/MaximeDaigle/sudoku'> Sudoku Solver </a> <span class="small"> Python </span> </h4>
					<p> 3 algorithms to solve sudoku puzzles: <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hill_climbing'>Hill Climbing</a> (an algorithm that finds the local optima), <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing'>Simulated annealing</a> (an algorithm in the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain_Monte_Carlo'>Markov Chain Monte Carlo</a> family) and <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_satisfaction'>Constraint propagation</a>.</p>
					
					<h4> <a href='https://github.com/MaximeDaigle/McHacks2017'> VickSick </a> <span class="small"> Python </span> </h4>
					<p> An application that give the ability to text an AI to diagnose your symptoms. The application asks questions based on the previous answers to precise the symptoms until it reaches a good level of confidence that it has found the disease. It was made with <a href='https://www.twilio.com/'> twilio </a> and <a href='http://www.infermedica.com/'> infermedica </a> as a part of McHacks 2017.</p>
					
					<h4> <a href='https://github.com/MaximeDaigle/SpellChecker'> Spell Checker </a> <span class="small"> Python </span> </h4>
					<p> The program takes a txt file as a dictionary (any languages wrote with UTF-8 symbol). Then, it takes a txt file as an input, spellchecks the sentences and suggests correction. It uses a hash table with a <a href ='http://www.csd.uwo.ca/courses/CS2210b/Lecture5.pdf'> polynomial accumulation </a> hash function written with <a href= 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horner%27s_method'> Horner's rule</a>.</p>
					
					<h4> <a href='https://github.com/MaximeDaigle/android'> Best Buy app </a> <span class="small"> Android Studio (java) </span> </h4>
					<p> An android application to shop at Best Buy. (<a href='https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwFg9-XyjkxINVAzWWpYMHVMUjA/view?usp=sharing'>powerpoint</a> that presents the app)  </p>

					<h4> <a href='https://github.com/MaximeDaigle/Graph-isomorphism'> Graph isomorphism </a> <span class="small"> Python </span> </h4>
					<p> It solves the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_isomorphism'> graph isomorphism </a> problem (belonging to NP) with a <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtracking'> backtracking algorithm</a>.</p>
					
					<h4> <a href='https://github.com/MaximeDaigle/Maximum-independent-set'> Maximum independent set (stable set) </a> <span class="small"> Python </span> </h4>
					<p> It solves the maximum independent set problem that is an NP-hard optimization problem. In graph theory, an <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_set_(graph_theory)'> independent set</a> or stable set is a set of vertices in a graph, no two of which are adjacent. </p>
					
					<h4> <a href='https://github.com/MaximeDaigle/GameOfLifeModified'> Game of life modified </a> <span class="small"> Python </span> </h4>
					<p> This version has 3 types of live cell (Red, Green, Blue) and you can change the rules for each type of cell separately. </p>
						
					<h4> <a href='https://github.com/MaximeDaigle/Quoridor'>Quoridor</a> <span class="small">Swing (Java) </span> </h4>
					<p> Quoridor is played on a 9x9 game board. Each player begins at the center space of one edge of the board. The objective is to be the first player to move their pawn to any space on the opposite side of the gameboard from which it begins. The distinguishing characteristic of Quoridor is its twenty walls. The walls are divided equally among the players at the start of the game, and once placed, cannot be moved or removed. In this project, I did the user interface using Model-View-Controller architecture.</p>

					<h4> <a href='https://github.com/MaximeDaigle/Labyrinthe'>Invisible Labyrinth</a>  <span class="small">Java</span> </h4>
					<p> It creates a random labyrinth in a shell. You have only a few seconds to memorize it before the walls become invisible. You have to go to the end with a limited number of lives.</p>

					<h4> <a href='https://github.com/MaximeDaigle/EightQueens_Puzzle'>Eigth Queens Puzzle</a><span class="small"> Java </span> </h4>
					<p> The eight queens puzzle is the problem of placing eight chess queens on an 8×8 chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. Thus, a solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. This program finds 11 solutions.</p>
					
					<h4> <a href="https://github.com/MaximeDaigle/AddictionSolitaire">Addiction Solitaire</a></a><span class="small"> JavaScript </span> </h4>
					<p> The goal is to create a row for each suit, where each row starts with the deuce on the left and the king on the right. Three reshuffles are allowed for times when you get stuck. Reshuffling affects all cards not in their proper position.  </p>
